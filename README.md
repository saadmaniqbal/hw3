third homework for COSC 4370 Prof. Z. Deng

This homework was completed in Visual Studio 2017. Some of the instructions provided on the pdf to install glew glfw glm were confusing, so i looked at youtube videos in addition to the instructions to make it work, e.g. glew32s.lib was used instead of glew32.lib. All four of the files uploaded have been completed as per instructed. The final cube is provided as screenshot.

The basics about the Phong shading algorithm and techniques, in addition from the lecture slides, have been learnt from the book "Learn OpenGL" by Frahaan Hussain.

Outside the specified requirements mentioned in the homework pdf, there is no other requirements necessary to run the program. Just hit run and it should compile and produce the 3D cube on screen.
